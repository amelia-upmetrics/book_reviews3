### Prepping the data  
**Start by loading the tidyverse library**
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

**Then read the csv**
```{r}
book_reviews<-read_csv("book_reviews.csv")
```

### Summarizing the data 

```{r}
dim(book_reviews)
```

There are 2000 rows and 4 columns in this data table. 
```{r}
col_names<-colnames(book_reviews)
```
The columns represent the book name, the review it received, the state it was sold in, and the price of the book.   
  
Next look at the type of each column 
```{r}
for (c in col_names){
  print(typeof(book_reviews[[c]]))
}
```
```{r}
for (c in col_names){
  print("Unique Values in Column:")
  print(c)
  print(unique(book_reviews[[c]]))
  print("")
}
```
